      <h2>The Stanton Harcourt Tradition</h2>

      <p>Stanton Harcourt (Oxon.) is a small village dating from a Bronze Age settlement six miles west
      of Oxford, and more significantly, in Morris terms, 2 miles south of Eynsham, a scene of more
      intense historical Morris activity. The village is noted as the home of the Harcourt family at the
      Manor from 12th - 18th century, and now back in residence after a couple of centuries in Nuneham
      Courtney. The Harcourts are the only surviving family of the Norman Conquest in Oxfordshire
      and received the manor from King Stephen. The tower in the Manor is known as ‘Pope’s Tower’
      after Alexander Pope, who translated ‘The Iliad’ there in 1718, and The Great Kitchen built in
      1380 still stands receiving regular use.</p>

      <p>The village has a feel of feudal England about it, but the accessible history of Morris dancing
      in the area principally concerns the hamlet of Sutton to the north of the manorial estate, where George
      Goodlake was master of the local hostelry. </p>

      <p>Stanton Harcout is a reconstructed Tradition based on manuscript sources.  A number of interpretations exist.</p>

      <p>The are twelve dances in the Stanton Harcourt collection. Ten dances are interpreted from the Manning / Carter
        manuscripts and two dances have been derived by the Ickneild Way Morris Men.  Five are stick dances and three are clapping dances.  The dances are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Constant Billy (clapping dance)</li>
        <li>Bean Planting (stick)</li>
        <li>The clock (clapping dance)</li>
        <li>Nightingale (stick)</li>
        <li>Jockey to the Fair</li>
        <li>Greensleeves (stick)</li>
        <li>Morris Off (IWMM)</li>
        <li>Brighton Camp (stick)</li>
        <li>Pricess Royal (clapping dance)</li>
        <li>A Nutting we will go / Nutting Girl</li>
        <li>Maid of the Mill (IWMM)</li>
        <li>Nightingale (stick)</li>
        <li>Black Joke (Stick)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Set</h2>
      <p>Dances are typically for six Dancers arranged in two lines of three facing each other.</p>
      <p>According to Dommett, the spacing between Dancers in the set should be about finger tip to finger tip along the line.</p>

      <h2>The Steps</h2>
      <h3>Double Step</h3>
      <p>The primary stepping sequence for dancing on the spot is the Double Step.  The Double Step is three changes and a hop on the
        third supporting foot, where the change of weight from one foot to the other is done quickly. The feet travel forward and need
        not be lifted very much, so the leg remains fairly striaght.  Each double step takes one bar, which is the equivalent of two walking
        steps.

      <p>Dommett suggests keeping the free foot nearly parallel to the ground and neither pointed or curled up.</p>

      <h3>Back Step</h3>
      <p>The Back Step is used to retire backwards and is based on a hop.  The movement is step and hop, step and hop.  The free foot is turned
        on the hop so that the heel comes across towards the instep of the supporting foot.</p>

      <h3>Jump</h3>
      <p>Jumps are used as punctuation in the dance movement.  The Dancer is off the ground at least twice as long as for an ordinary step and
        hop and the musician is expected to stretch out the music at this point to allow the dancer to emphasise the movement.  The arms help
        the jump by providing balance and should be swung up to the level of the top of the head and not started to be bought down till the
        toes are touching the ground again.</p>

      <h3>Basic Dance Sequence</h3>
      <p>The most frequently used sequence of stepping is two Double Steps, followed by two Back Steps and a step and a Jump to land both feet
        together.  This take four bars of music.</p>

      <h3>Side Step</h3>
      <p>The Side Step is to be performed vigerously with no forward movement. The conventional Double Step is modified so that the leading
        foot for the Double Step is brought down strongly in fron of the other foot instead of beside it on the first beat of the bar.  This
        implies that the body rocks a little forward and back during each Side Step.  The free foot on this beat is brought up behind the calf
        of the forward leg.  Notice that the Side Step is not a true Side Step as there is no sideways movement only an aligning of the feet.
        The accompanying arm movements are the normal down and up swings but done more vigerously and with a longer travel.</p>

      <h3>Handkerchiefs</h3>
      <p>Handkerchiefs (Hks) are tied to little fingers for all dances, which is necessary for clapping. When not clapping, the handkerchiefs
        run across the palm exiting between thumb and forefinger.

      <p>Stanton Harcourt is not a tradition where many dances are performed with handkerchiefs alone.  The handkerchief should be 17 - 18 inches square and when
        held by one corner with arms by the sides the other corner should touch the ground.</p>

      <p>The arms should swing so that the handkerchiefs move from about head height on the upward swing, that is with the hands about upper chest level,
        and behind the sides of the body on the down swing, that is hands besides hips.</P>

      <p>Dommett points out that the movement of the handkerchiefs rather than the arms is what is seem by the audience and these must be more flowing, without jerks or flicks.</p>

      <p>The handkerchiefs in the backstep are held out at the side of the body, the arms with the elbows into the side of the body, hands with palms upwards and slightly forward of the body.
        The handkerchief reaches this position from the upswing in the previous bar of stepping with the hands opening out rather than continuing upwards.  The handkerchiefs swing into the jumps with a scooping jesture, the hands
        moving out and down then inwards and up.</p>

      <p>The arms are normally held out at the end of bar 6 of the music, come in, out, in and up (above head) on the 4 accented beats of the last 2 bars.
        The arms remain up to be brought down forcefully for the next figure. Handkerchief dances in particular should have vigorous arm movements. On the
        final 4 capers dances should meet in the centre, hands knuckle to knuckle.</p>

      <h2>Common figures</h2>
      <p>There are five common figures in the Stanton Harcourt dances: simple collective movements which use the basic dance sequence or a variant of it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advance Meet And Retire</li>
        <p>Dancers dance towards their opposite on the double step, to be face to face along the centre line of the set,
          retiring to place on the backstep and jump.  This is repeated to complete the figure. Dancers face the same way throughout.</p>
        <li>Cross Over</li>
        <p>In the Cross Over the Dancers change places at the half way point in the figure.  The Dancers start by moving foward and
          a little to their left to pass their opposite by the right shoulder.  On the hop of the first double step the Dancers turn right, half way, to face back,
           face to face with their opposite.  The second double is on the spot and then the Dancers retire to theoir opposites place on the backstep and jump.
          The second half of the figure starts passing left shoulder and is also a mirror image of the first.</p>
        <li>Back To Back</li>
        <p>Dancers face the same way throughout, the same as for Advance Meet And Retire.  The Dancers start by moving foward and
          a little to their left to pass their opposite by the right shoulder by the end of the first double step.  During the second double
          step the pair move in an arc to their right so that they are almost left shoulder to left shoulder by the end of the double step.
          They retire to place on the backstep and jump.
          The second half is a mirror image, going the other way round the opposite.</p>
        <li>Dance Facing</li>
        <p>Dance Facing and Whole Rounds are a variant on the Basic Dance Sequence.  The figure comprises of 6 double steps followed by Back Step and Jump.
          A dance begins with Dance Facing in which all Dancers face their partner and dance this modified sequence on the spot.</p>
        <li>Whole Rounds</li>
        <p>The dance ends with Whole Rounds in which the whole set dance a large circle clockwise, following each other.  Because it is the last figure of the dance
        the set can become larger during the movement, the Dancers do not have to reach any particular place at the end of the musical phrase.  At the very end they come
         into the centre of the set to form a small bunch for All In.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The figures are typically danced in order of increasing amount of travel, as follows:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Dance Facing</li>
          <li>Advance Meet and Retire</li>
          <li>Cross Over</li>
          <li>Back To Back</li>
          <li>Whole Rounds and All In</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Half Hey and Whole Hey
          <p> A frequent element of chorus figures is the Half Hey or Whole Hey.  The path traced during a Hey is a figure of eight and each line of dancers
            mirrors the other so that each pair dance together.  The top pair turn up and end facing down the line of the set without making much of a loop
            or getting much further apart.  They then dance down the line of the set to the bottom place, coming in towards each other, then facing each other
            across the set at the end of the second Double Step.  The middle pair start by moving into the centre of the set, facing up and shoulder to shoulder,
            and dance around a circular loop, going between the top pair as they come down the set, and coming into the centre of the set face to face at the
            end of the second double step, again in middle position in the set. The bottom pair turn down and make a moderate loop so that the top and middle
            pairs have cleared the middle of the set. They then dance to the top position passing behing the tops and in front of the middles, ending face to
            face as the other pairs.  All the Dancers then Back Step and jump, retiring out to their new places, in a line along the side of the set as in the
            other figures.  In the Stanton Harcout tradition the middle pair always go up to the top of the set, so in the second half of a Whole Hey the pairs
            dance as described for the position they are starting in.  Thus the middle always dance the same thing but the ends dance differently depending on
            the end they are starting from at that moment.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dommett considers it essential to generate some drive into each half of the figures to create a lively impression. He says that the time taken
        to accelerate into the first double step from the jump can be long and make the dancing look slack.  He also comments that the jumps should not
        end with the body vertical and balanced, but with the body leaning forward ready to move quickly, which is best achieved by making sure the
        feet on landing are behind the normal standing position by upto a foot's length.</p>

      <p>There are rules on which foot to start.  The convention is to refer to the foot that is supporting the weight.  The figures start on the Left
        foot but after the first jump the Dancers start again on the Right foot.  The change of lead makes it essential that the jump ends landing with
        feet together rather than on one foot.</P>

      <h2>Style points</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>In the Back Step it is desirable that the hands of neighbouring Dancers almost touch so that a line appears along the set.</li>
      <li>In dance facing it helps if all Dancers move forward a foot or so on the first step of the first Double Step to give emphasis and allowing some
        backwards movement on the Back Step and Jump.</li>
      <li>The first step of each figure should be a strong movement, with more emphasis than any other step in the figure.</li>
      <li>The second Double Step of each half of the Advance Meet and Retire and Crossover is danced face to face with the opposite, quite close,along
        the centre line of the set.</li>
      <li>For the Whole Rounds Dancers on the even side of the set should turn out (i.e. turn right) to face clockwise. Dancers on the odds side of the
        set can either take the easy way in to the Whole Rounds (i.e. quarter turn to the left) or turn to the right.</li>
      <li>At the end of the Whole Rounds the Dancers move into the centre of the set and pause.  Instead of the final jump ending with feet together,
        this time the Dancers should spring from one foot to the other and pause with the free foot in the air in the centre of the set.  The arms
        should be upraised, knuckles almost touching neighbour's forming a small circle.</li>
      </ul>
