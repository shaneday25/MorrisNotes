      <h2>Jockey To The Fair</h2>
      <h3>Formation</h3>
      <p>Set of 6, in 3 pairs - conventional.</p>

      <h3>Style</h3>
      <p>Handkerchief. Corner dance.</p>

      <h3>Dance Sequence</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Once to yourself</li>
          <li>Dance Facing</li>
          <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
          <li>Advance Meet And Retire</li>
          <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
          <li>Crossover</li>
          <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
          <li>Back to Back</li>
          <li>Distinctive Figure</li>
          <li>Whole Rounds</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Distinctive Figure</h3>
      <p>First corners facing 4 x Side Steps, vigerously, followed by 1 Double Step with opposite corner, 1 Double Step
        on the spot and 2 Back Steps to opposite place with hand movemnets.  This sequence is repeated by the second corners
       and then the middles. </p>

      <h3>Variations</h3>
      <p>Dommett points out that there is no instructions for this dance in the mss, but goes on to describe how it was taught
        by Dave Robinson.  The dance is similar to the Nutting Girl in that the dancers face up and dance four bars of Side Step,
        then, because the B music is 14 bars long, there follows a Whole Hey taking 8 bars ending with all facinf opposites and
        then doing four Plain Capers.  The Plain Capers are high springs from one foot to the other, 2 per bar like much exagerated
        dance walks, aiming for the elevation and not for kicking the leg forward.  The handkerchiefs are waved, making circles
        in the vertical plane, centered at waist level, by the side of the body.  The whole Distinctive Figure can be repeated
        or not depending on how long the dance is wished to be run.</p>

      <p>Other variants seen include:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dancing the Side Step facing opposite rather than facing up.  This looses a similarity with the Bampton and Eynsham
            traditions, but provides an alternative if further tunes for the Side Step and Half Hey are to be used.</li>
          <li>Facing up, but dancing long open Side Steps to change places with opposite and a long open Side Step back before the
            Half Hey.  This would be a normal open Side Step, stepping to the side and closing the trailing foot to it four times.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>The B music, which is 14 bars long, is played for the Whole Rounds.</p>
