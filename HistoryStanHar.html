      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>ToDo - sort this section ******************************************************ToDo</p>
      <p>Our knowledge of historical Morris activity in Stanton comes from two documents viz. Percy
      Manning's account in ‘Folklore’ (Seasons) 11, (1) and a manuscript dated ca. 1920 ascribed to
      Arthur Williams (2). Manning was an Oxfordshire folklorist who amongst other things,
      encouraged the revival of the Morris in Headington which was the team seen by Sharp in 1899.
      What followed became history.</p>

      <p>Manning paid a retired geologist/fossil collector Thomas Carter as a researcher to go to
      Stanton (there is an account of an expenses claim from Carter for 1s 2d for the train fare from
      Oxford). Carter wrote to Manning ca. 1897 reporting that he had retrieved the ‘whittle’ of ‘Bob’
      (sic.) Potter (actually John) the legendary Stanton Harcourt Morris musician. Although Potter
      had died by this time, Carter had located his daughter living at Tumbledown Dick’s in Cumnor.
      John Potter (b. 1813) was of local fame as a Morris musician, and known principally for his pipe
      and tabor ('whittle n' dub) playing around Oxfordshire. He was described as a whittle player
      who ‘could almost make un speak’ (3) having acquired his instrument from ‘Barber’ Brooks of
      the Dragon Inn, Bampton. The whittle was made by Robert Brooks before 1820 and had the
      holes marked with the notes. Potter played whittle for many Morrises including Stanton
      Harcourt, Standlake, Bampton, Witney, Cogges, Leafield; Clanfield; Oxford and Faringdon (4).
      He was also reported (in 1895) as having played for the Ducklington Morris around 1865 (5). </p>

      <p>John Potter was born and lived in the hamlet of Sutton. He is variously described as a
      carrier/carpenter/labourer/etc. In later life he played the fiddle and there is a photograph of him
      playing for the sweeps Jack-in-the-Green at Balliol College, in 1886 on May Day (6). He was
      not interviewed by Carter and died at his home in St. Ebbe’s, Oxford on March 8th 1892, having
      moved into the city when he was 69. He was buried in the churchyard at Stanton. From his age
      we might assume the Morris was active in Stanton ca. 1835.</p>

      <p>Carter did interview an old Stanton Harcourt Dancer, Joseph Goodlake (b. 1836) when he was
      63 (? This would have been 1899 but the letter suggests March 1901). Joseph was the son of
      George Goodlake of Sutton whose career from labourer (1818), baker (1830), shopkeeper
      (1836) to publican (1842) reveals a man set on improving his social status. He also had 14
      children (8 girls and 6 boys) and since Joseph had brothers within + 5 years of his age they
      could also have conceivably been in the Stanton/Sutton team. This would place the active
      dancing period around the 1850’s but the eldest brother William, could have been dancing ca.
      1838. Joseph Goodlake, described as a shepherd/farm worker, moved to Yarnton where he
      died from cirrhosis of the liver in July 1901 just 4 months after Carter's interview (7).
      No evidence has appeared to suggest Morris activity either before this period or after it.
      Furthermore no Stanton Harcourt set is ever referred to in the many inter-village competitions
      that prevailed during the 19th C (8). There are two unusual features about the descriptions of
      the dances in Manning (which are not extensive!). Firstly, the dances all feature an inward
      facing Distinctive Figure and this has been extrapolated to exclusively inward facing Common
      Figures. This may however be entirely interpretational.</p>

      <p>Secondly, five of the dances listed involve sticks, which is highly unusual in a region dominated
      by handkerchief-only traditions (Ducklington, Bampton, Eynsham and Abingdon). Sticks
      appeared to have made no general inroads into this area when they started to be incorporated
      into Morris dancing from the late 18th C.</p>

      <p>Bearing the above in mind along with the vigorous Morris activity in surrounding villages this
      may be a case for applying Keith Chandler's arguments for the commercial motivation of the
      19th C. Morris (9). Were the Stanton dances contrived in mid century without any local historical
      derivation as part of an entertainment centred on a public house in Sutton? (See also John
      Forrest on this point (10)) A contrivance of this sort would then seek to produce something
      more contrasting with surrounding styles. From general Morris evolutionary features we might
      expect any older Stanton Harcourt dances to use handkerchiefs but the only notation for a
      handkerchief dance per se (non hand clapping) comes from the Williams manuscript. (See
      Appendix B)</p>
